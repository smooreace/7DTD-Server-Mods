INSTALLATION:

ALWAYS backup your game! THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE DONE BEFORE INSTALLING ANY NEW MOD - EVEN WITH A MOD MANAGER!

The best way to install mods is to use a mod manager. I use Vortex. But there are others available such as Mod Organizer 2 and Nexus Mod Manager. There should be a button to learn more about Vortex at the bottom of the Nexus webpage. The other two can be downloaded from Nexus; just search for them. There are videos available on YouTube on how to install and setup these programs that I would suggest you watch. They might also help you decide which of the three you'd like to use. Installing a mod is then just as simple as pressing the button on the download page. Your installed mod manager will do the rest.

To install a mod manually:
﻿1. Back up your game files! 
﻿2. Create a folder called "Mods" in your 7 Days to Day installation folder - "\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die"
﻿3. Extract the folder in the Mod's zip file into the Mods directory. Each mod you install should have its own directory.
﻿4. Start the Game
﻿5. Done
